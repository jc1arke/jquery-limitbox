{"name":"Jquery-limitbox","tagline":"","body":"Simple Text Limiting\r\n====================\r\n\r\nI recently had to write a little widget for the front-end wherein the user has to be able to type, copy &amp; paste, etc etc some text\r\ninto a text area, but he/she need to be limited on the amount of characters that they can use. Yes, there are plenty of pre-existing\r\nplugins etc that I could use, but I like demonstrating how one would go about doing something similar using just a bit of logic and jQuery :)\r\n\r\nQuick demo\r\n----------\r\n\r\nA test index.html (or you can view it on <a href='http://jsfiddle.net/jcinteractive/pxjM9/embedded/result/' target='_blank'>jsFiddle</a>) is included that demonstrates how the plugin is used, but the gist of it is:\r\n\r\n\t<textarea id=\"test\" class=\"limitBoxes\" cols=\"55\" rows=\"5\"></textarea>\r\n\t<script src='http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js'></script>\r\n\t<script src='./js/jquery.limitbox.js'></script>\r\n\t<script>\r\n\t$(\"#test\").limitBox({\r\n\t  limit: 200,\r\n\t  limitCounter: \"counter\",\r\n\t  container: \"container\"\r\n\t});\r\n\t</script>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
